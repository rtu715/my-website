<p class="about-text">
Welcome! I'm currently a second-year Master's student at the Machine Learning Department of Carnegie Mellon Univerisity. My advisor is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/"> Ameet Talwalkar</a>. 
My research is motivated by developing ML tools and frameworks to benefit various end users, current including but not limited to the fields of neural architecture search and federated learning. I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and History from Columbia University.
