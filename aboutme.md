### My story

<p> I grew up in Beijing, China where I commuted 1.5 hours to and from school on a daily basis. When I was 13, I moved to a town with 5,000 population in Massachusetts and spent 4 years studying there. Contrastingly, I then went to \* the greatest college, in the greatest university, in the greatest city in the world \* (self-proclaimed). <br> Now I do machine learning at CMU. </p>


### Pastime

- Education for the Body: I play tennis when it's warm and I ski when it's cold.

- Education for the Soul: I have an eclectic playlist consisting of K-Pop, Classical, Rock, and Latino. 

- Achieving true Wisdom: [Stats at CMU](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/)

- Training in Dialectic: usually happens with beers and wines.
